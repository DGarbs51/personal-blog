  <p>
    Hi, I'm Devon Garbalosa — a technologist, builder, architect, and leader
    with a developer's heart and an operator's mindset. I've spent the last
    decade building scalable, secure, and thoughtful software systems that help
    real people solve real problems.
  </p>

  <h2>My Background</h2>
  <p>
    I started my career in data engineering before falling headfirst into
    Laravel — a framework that didn't just give me better tools, it gave me
    purpose and belonging in tech. Since then, I've built and led engineering
    initiatives across highly regulated enterprise environments, working across
    infrastructure, architecture, and leadership to guide globally distributed
    teams and build platforms used at scale.
  </p>
  <p>
    I live with ADHD, and it's a huge part of how I move through the world. It's
    shaped how I lead, how I learn, and how I design systems that make space for
    clarity, flexibility, and flow.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Do</h2>
  <p>
    I specialize in Laravel application architecture on top of modern
    cloud-native, event-driven systems. When I'm not deploying infrastructure or
    mentoring engineers, I'm writing, gaming, or exploring national parks — 34
    and counting.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Platform architecture and developer onboarding</li>
    <li>Serverless cloud systems using AWS (Lambda, SQS, S3, EventBridge)</li>
    <li>Infrastructure as Code and compliance-aware deployment pipelines</li>
    <li>AI/ML integration including OCR/ICR and Human-in-the-Loop workflows</li>
    <li>Technical storytelling across dev, exec, and customer contexts</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why I Write</h2>
  <p>
    This blog is my way of thinking in public. Writing here helps me reflect,
    stay honest, and capture the shape of my thoughts before they get lost in
    the noise of daily life. It's about mental health, transparency, and sharing
    what it feels like to build — in the messy, human, sometimes chaotic way
    that real building happens.
  </p>
  <p>
    I write for anyone who's navigating leadership, code, learning, ADHD, or
    just trying to make a little more sense of things. Whether you're early in
    your career or ten years in, I hope what you find here helps you feel a
    little more seen.
  </p>

  <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
  <p>
    I love connecting with others — developers, leaders, writers, mentors, or
    just curious people asking better questions. If anything I've written
    resonates, I hope you'll reach out. We grow better together.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Currently:</strong> Leading product engineering efforts at a major financial
    services company, thinking about what it means to be a finisher, and sketching
    ideas for the kind of firm I hope to build one day.
