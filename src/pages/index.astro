      <h1>👋 Hey, I'm Devon</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my blog — a space where I think out loud, reflect on the
        messy parts of building, and try to make sense of the work, the
        industry, and myself in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a technologist, architect, and team leader with a background in
        cloud-native Laravel development and enterprise-scale infrastructure.
        I've spent over a decade working in financial services, building
        platforms, mentoring engineers, and trying to lead with empathy,
        clarity, and purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        This blog is part engineering journal, part leadership log, and part
        personal chronicle. I started it to step outside the echo chamber of my
        own head — to make space for transparency, mental health, and sharing
        the thinking *as it happens*, not just after it's polished.
      </p>

      <h2>What you'll find here:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>📚 Deep dives into Laravel and cloud architecture</li>
        <li>💭 Reflections on leadership, ADHD, and mental clarity</li>
        <li>🛠️ Lessons from building systems and mentoring teams</li>
        <li>🚧 Stories of mistakes, pivots, and unfinished thoughts</li>
        <li>
          🌲 Bits of life beyond tech — like photography, games, and national
          parks
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I'm not here to teach from a mountaintop — I'm here to learn out loud.
        If you're building, leading, struggling, dreaming, or just figuring it
        out: I hope you find something useful here.
